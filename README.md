ASSIGNMENT 2 ReadME

Formal Elements: Players: Up to 2 players are allowed and required to play, uniform roles, players have to cooperate with each other to win. Objectives: Capture, players have to destroy all drones to win. Drones can be destroyed by opposite colored bird. Red bird can destroy blue drones, blue bird can destroy red drones.

Outcome: Players have to cooperate with each other to destroy the drones to open the doors and get to the end of the computer system.

Unusual procedure/rule: The bird speed is increased each time you pass through a level. The drones are color-specific, meaning that the red bird can only destroy the blue drones, and the blue bird can only destroy the red drones.

We followed the game theme by having our player model as a bird, and the birds are in a computer system. The computer system have levels; Main Memory, L3, L2, L1, and CPU. We also have computer drones, which are our obstacles and targets, and the birds have to destroy those to pass through the level.

Executive Summary: Assignment 2 is a multiplayer networking focused game for Windows Users targeted at boys and girls between 10 and 16 who are learning about computer architecture.
